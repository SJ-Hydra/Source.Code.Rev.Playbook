# source_code_review
Just my notes. 


Code review does not need to review the entire software but instead just aspect or sections of the code for which there has been change. Input validation is the first and primary check, to ensure untrusted data is being handled appropriately and cant be misused. This input validation should block characters that have no use purpose in the system, through the use of a ‘white list,’ a list of characters that are permitted within the field.
